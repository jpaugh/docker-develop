Jonathan,

When building a minor version, don't put things "in order," no matter how badly you want to! Instead, put new things at the bottom, and sort them out later.

At each major version, re-sort all of the existing tags, and push; do no other changes in the major release.

Reasons:
    1. Each time you modify base layers, each higher layer has to be re-built, re-pushed, and re-downloaded by users, even though nothing has changed.
    2. It's good to have a major version which actually works! Whenever the current additions are substantial and vetted, it's a good time for a major release!
